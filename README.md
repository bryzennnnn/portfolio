Hello! My name is Bryzen ([Pronouns: he/him](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/why-pronouns-matter)) and I study Public Affairs and Economics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am an aspiring applied, quantitative social scientist, where I hope to utilize a variety of empirical techniques to understand poverty and social inequality; that is, how do economic activities and systems, social units, and political institutions shape the experiences of people living in poverty and what can public policy and administration do to mitigate them.
